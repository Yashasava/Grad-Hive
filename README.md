# Grad-Hive
The Campus Requirement API is a Spring Boot REST API project designed to facilitate the 
management of campus job postings and student applications. It allows institutions to post 
job opportunities and enables students to apply for these jobs. The primary entities in the 
system are Students, Users, Job Postings, Job Application and Interviews. The application 
aims to streamline the hiring process, improve communication between students and 
employers, and maintain an organized database of job opportunities.

# Objectives
✓ Automate the job application process through a REST API to enhance integration with 
existing systems.
✓ Ensure data accuracy with automated validation and storage of job postings and 
applications.
✓ Facilitate seamless communication between students and employers to improve hiring 
workflows

#Workflow
1. Student Registration:
o A student can register using the Student entity and can log in to the system.
2. Viewing Job Postings:
o After logging in, the student can view all available JobPostings.
3. Applying for a Job:
o When a student applies for a job, a new JobApplication is created with the 
status APPLIED. The JobPosting is linked to the JobApplication.
4. Approval of Job Application:
o The job posting owner (admin/company) reviews the application. If 
approved, the JobApplication status is updated to APPROVED.
5. Scheduling an Interview:
o After approval, the student can schedule an interview by creating an 
Interview entity, linked to the JobApplication

#Scope of the Project
The scope of the Campus Requirement project involves developing a REST API to manage 
job postings and student applications, including functionalities for handling Users, Students, 
Job Postings, and Job Applications.

#Project Structure
Overview of Project Architecture: The project follows a layered architecture pattern, with 
distinct layers for handling different aspects of functionality and data management

#Layers Description
1. Controller Layer: Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, 
and returning appropriate responses.
2. Service Layer: Acts as an intermediary between the controller and the data access layer 
(DAO).
3. DAO (Data Access Object) Layer: Responsible for interacting with the database and 
performing CRUD operations.

#Responsibilities of each layer
• Controller Layer:
➢ Handle incoming HTTP requests.
➢ Validate request parameters and payload.
➢ Invoke appropriate methods in the service layer.
➢ Format and return HTTP responses.
• Service Layer:
➢ Implement business logic and rules.
➢ Coordinate interactions between controllers and DAOs.
➢ Perform data manipulation and transformation.
➢ Manage transactions and ensure data integrity.
• DAO Layer:
➢ Provide CRUD operations for accessing and modifying data.
➢ Translate database queries and commands into appropriate SQL statements.
➢ Handle database transactions and connections.
➢ Abstract away database-specific details from the service layer.

#Used Technology Stack
✓ Backend Framework: Spring Boot 2
✓ Database: MySQL
✓ Database Framework: Hibernate 5
✓ Java: JDK 1.8
✓ Build Tool: Maven
✓ Development Environment: Eclipse
✓ API Testing Tool: Postman
